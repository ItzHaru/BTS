    <h1>BTS Fandom</h1>
  </header>
  <main class="container">
    <p>BTS's official fandom name is ARMY or A.R.M.Y (Hangul: 아미). It was officially established on July 9, 2013 after
      the first recruitment closed.</p>

      <!-- Meaning -->
    <h3 class="pt-1">Meaning</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>2013</h4>
    <p>"A.R.M.Y" stands for "Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth" and it carries quite some meaning behind it, given
      that "Army" is associated with the military, body armor, and how those two things are always together, the fandom
      name basically means that fans will always be together with BTS.</p>
    <h4>2017</h4>
    <p>BTS and A.R.M.Y are almost mirrored mages of each other and they have a relationship that is affected by each
      other. The symbol of A.R.M.Y is expressed as a door on their viewpoint who is waiting & welcoming BTS on the
      opposite door when BTS opens a new door.</p>
